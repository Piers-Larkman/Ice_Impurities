Example to include:

For model generation:
- Simple Voronoi growth illustration(s) (in 2d and 3d)
- Model building in small space
- CAN make a version that assumes 100 % correlation and no deviation - therefore grain interiors have concentration of some set-value (0, or 0.1 or free parameter...) and boundaries of 1
